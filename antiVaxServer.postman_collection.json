Specifically, some parents are worried that children are receiving too many vaccines while they are too young to deal with them, thus overloading their immune system. Some parents are now requesting alternative immunization schedules, either reducing or delaying the number of vaccines that their children receive in a single well-child checkup.</p><p>Parents’ concerns about the number of vaccines children receive today are understandable. There are many more vaccines offered to children today than in the past. However, there are several facts that support the use of the recommended immunization schedule.</p><h2>Why we use vaccines:</h2><p>Vaccines protect against many diseases which often result in serious complications, hospitalizations and even death. With more vaccines recommended, children can now be protected against more diseases than they were in the past. Before vaccines, every year in Canada:</p><ul><li>there were 350 000 cases and 1500-2000 hospitalizations due to varicella (chicken pox)</li<li>there were 15 000 to 20 000 cases of pertussis (whooping cough)</li><li>there were over 900 cases of invasive Hib disease (eg. meningitis or pneumonia)</li></ul><p>Vaccines have reduced or eliminated many of these diseases that once routinely harmed infants, children and adults. However, even though vaccines have reduced these diseases, the germs that cause vaccine-preventable diseases still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. High vaccination rates are still required to protect children from disease and to keep the diseases out of our communities.</p><h2>Why we give babies vaccines:</h2><p>Children are given vaccines at a young age because children are most vulnerable to certain diseases when they are young. If a child is not vaccinated and is exposed to a disease, the child’s body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. The current NACI recommended immunization schedule is specifically designed to protect children when they are most at risk.</p><h2>How vaccine ingredients have changed:</h2><p>Despite the increase in the total number of vaccines given, children are exposed to fewer foreign proteins (antigens) in vaccines today than in the past. Until 1972, children received about 200 proteins from just the smallpox vaccine. Today, with advances in protein chemistry, the 14 routinely recommended vaccines contain fewer than 150 proteins in total. In other words, all of the vaccines given to children today have fewer overall antigens than the smallpox vaccine alone.</p><h2>Babies are well equipped to fight off germs in the environment:</h2><p>Infants have an enormous capacity to respond safely and effectively to multiple vaccines. From the moment they are born, infants are exposed to trillions of germs in the environment and their immune systems are well equipped to handle the immune response produced by the vaccine. The immunological challenge from vaccines is very small compared to what babies’ immune systems deal with every day. In other words, babies’ immune systems are constantly fighting off germs from others and their environments every day.</p><h2>Safety is the #1 consideration:</h2><p>Before vaccines are approved for use, their safety is studied extensively. They are tested alone and in combination with the existing vaccines to determine whether they affect the safety of the other vaccines. These multiple vaccine studies are always done before a new vaccine is added to the vaccination schedule.</p><h2>What the studies say:</h2><p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics titled 'On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes” compared children who had received all their vaccines on time during the first year of life with children who did not, looking for differences in neuropsychological (this means the brain and behavior connections) outcomes at 7 to 10 years of age. The study found that timely vaccination during infancy did not cause neuropsychological outcomes in children 7 to 10 years of age and later.</p><p>There is no evidence that timely receipt of currently recommended vaccines overloads or weakens the child’s immune system. Vaccine decline or delay, on the other hand, may leave a child at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.</p><h2>References:</h2><ul><li><a href='http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm'>http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm</a></li><li>Offit PA, Quarles J, Gerber MA, Hackett CJ, Marcuse EK, Kollman TR, Gellin BG, Landry S.

Specifically, some parents are worried that children are receiving too many vaccines while they are too young to deal with them, thus overloading their immune system. Some parents are now requesting alternative immunization schedules, either reducing or delaying the number of vaccines that their children receive in a single well-child checkup.</p><p>Parents’ concerns about the number of vaccines children receive today are understandable. There are many more vaccines offered to children today than in the past. However, there are several facts that support the use of the recommended immunization schedule.</p><h2>Why we use vaccines:</h2><p>Vaccines protect against many diseases which often result in serious complications, hospitalizations and even death. With more vaccines recommended, children can now be protected against more diseases than they were in the past. Before vaccines, every year in Canada:</p><ul><li>there were 350 000 cases and 1500-2000 hospitalizations due to varicella (chicken pox)</li<li>there were 15 000 to 20 000 cases of pertussis (whooping cough)</li><li>there were over 900 cases of invasive Hib disease (eg. meningitis or pneumonia)</li></ul><p>Vaccines have reduced or eliminated many of these diseases that once routinely harmed infants, children and adults. However, even though vaccines have reduced these diseases, the germs that cause vaccine-preventable diseases still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. High vaccination rates are still required to protect children from disease and to keep the diseases out of our communities.</p><h2>Why we give babies vaccines:</h2><p>Children are given vaccines at a young age because children are most vulnerable to certain diseases when they are young. If a child is not vaccinated and is exposed to a disease, the child’s body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. The current NACI recommended immunization schedule is specifically designed to protect children when they are most at risk.</p><h2>How vaccine ingredients have changed:</h2><p>Despite the increase in the total number of vaccines given, children are exposed to fewer foreign proteins (antigens) in vaccines today than in the past. Until 1972, children received about 200 proteins from just the smallpox vaccine. Today, with advances in protein chemistry, the 14 routinely recommended vaccines contain fewer than 150 proteins in total. In other words, all of the vaccines given to children today have fewer overall antigens than the smallpox vaccine alone.</p><h2>Babies are well equipped to fight off germs in the environment:</h2><p>Infants have an enormous capacity to respond safely and effectively to multiple vaccines. From the moment they are born, infants are exposed to trillions of germs in the environment and their immune systems are well equipped to handle the immune response produced by the vaccine. The immunological challenge from vaccines is very small compared to what babies’ immune systems deal with every day. In other words, babies’ immune systems are constantly fighting off germs from others and their environments every day.</p><h2>Safety is the #1 consideration:</h2><p>Before vaccines are approved for use, their safety is studied extensively. They are tested alone and in combination with the existing vaccines to determine whether they affect the safety of the other vaccines. These multiple vaccine studies are always done before a new vaccine is added to the vaccination schedule.</p><h2>What the studies say:</h2><p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics titled 'On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes” compared children who had received all their vaccines on time during the first year of life with children who did not, looking for differences in neuropsychological (this means the brain and behavior connections) outcomes at 7 to 10 years of age.

Specifically, some parents are worried that children are receiving too many vaccines while they are too young to deal with them, thus overloading their immune system. Some parents are now requesting alternative immunization schedules, either reducing or delaying the number of vaccines that their children receive in a single well-child checkup.</p><p>Parents’ concerns about the number of vaccines children receive today are understandable. There are many more vaccines offered to children today than in the past. However, there are several facts that support the use of the recommended immunization schedule.</p><h2>Why we use vaccines:</h2><p>Vaccines protect against many diseases which often result in serious complications, hospitalizations and even death. With more vaccines recommended, children can now be protected against more diseases than they were in the past. Before vaccines, every year in Canada:</p><ul><li>there were 350 000 cases and 1500-2000 hospitalizations due to varicella (chicken pox)</li<li>there were 15 000 to 20 000 cases of pertussis (whooping cough)</li><li>there were over 900 cases of invasive Hib disease (eg. meningitis or pneumonia)</li></ul><p>Vaccines have reduced or eliminated many of these diseases that once routinely harmed infants, children and adults. However, even though vaccines have reduced these diseases, the germs that cause vaccine-preventable diseases still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. High vaccination rates are still required to protect children from disease and to keep the diseases out of our communities.</p><h2>Why we give babies vaccines:</h2><p>Children are given vaccines at a young age because children are most vulnerable to certain diseases when they are young. If a child is not vaccinated and is exposed to a disease, the child’s body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. The current NACI recommended immunization schedule is specifically designed to protect children when they are most at risk.</p><h2>How vaccine ingredients have changed:</h2><p>Despite the increase in the total number of vaccines given, children are exposed to fewer foreign proteins (antigens) in vaccines today than in the past. Until 1972, children received about 200 proteins from just the smallpox vaccine. Today, with advances in protein chemistry, the 14 routinely recommended vaccines contain fewer than 150 proteins in total. In other words, all of the vaccines given to children today have fewer overall antigens than the smallpox vaccine alone.</p><h2>Babies are well equipped to fight off germs in the environment:</h2><p>Infants have an enormous capacity to respond safely and effectively to multiple vaccines. From the moment they are born, infants are exposed to trillions of germs in the environment and their immune systems are well equipped to handle the immune response produced by the vaccine. The immunological challenge from vaccines is very small compared to what babies’ immune systems deal with every day. In other words, babies’ immune systems are constantly fighting off germs from others and their environments every day.</p><h2>Safety is the #1 consideration:</h2><p>Before vaccines are approved for use, their safety is studied extensively. They are tested alone and in combination with the existing vaccines to determine whether they affect the safety of the other vaccines. These multiple vaccine studies are always done before a new vaccine is added to the vaccination schedule.</p><h2>What the studies say:</h2><p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics titled 'On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes” compared children who had received all their vaccines on time during the first year of life with children who did not, looking for differences in neuropsychological (this means the brain and behavior connections) outcomes at 7 to 10 years of age. The study found that timely vaccination during infancy did not cause neuropsychological outcomes in children 7 to 10 years of age and later.</p><p>There is no evidence that timely receipt of currently recommended vaccines overloads or weakens the child’s immune system. Vaccine decline or delay, on the other hand, may leave a child at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.</p><h2>References:</h2><ul><li><a href='http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm'>http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm</a></li><li>Offit PA, Quarles J, Gerber MA, Hackett CJ, Marcuse EK, Kollman TR, Gellin BG, Landry S.

Specifically, some parents are worried that children are receiving too many vaccines while they are too young to deal with them, thus overloading their immune system. Some parents are now requesting alternative immunization schedules, either reducing or delaying the number of vaccines that their children receive in a single well-child checkup.</p><p>Parents’ concerns about the number of vaccines children receive today are understandable. There are many more vaccines offered to children today than in the past. However, there are several facts that support the use of the recommended immunization schedule.</p><h2>Why we use vaccines:</h2><p>Vaccines protect against many diseases which often result in serious complications, hospitalizations and even death. With more vaccines recommended, children can now be protected against more diseases than they were in the past. Before vaccines, every year in Canada:</p><ul><li>there were 350 000 cases and 1500-2000 hospitalizations due to varicella (chicken pox)</li<li>there were 15 000 to 20 000 cases of pertussis (whooping cough)</li><li>there were over 900 cases of invasive Hib disease (eg. meningitis or pneumonia)</li></ul><p>Vaccines have reduced or eliminated many of these diseases that once routinely harmed infants, children and adults. However, even though vaccines have reduced these diseases, the germs that cause vaccine-preventable diseases still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. High vaccination rates are still required to protect children from disease and to keep the diseases out of our communities.</p><h2>Why we give babies vaccines:</h2><p>Children are given vaccines at a young age because children are most vulnerable to certain diseases when they are young. If a child is not vaccinated and is exposed to a disease, the child’s body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. The current NACI recommended immunization schedule is specifically designed to protect children when they are most at risk.</p><h2>How vaccine ingredients have changed:</h2><p>Despite the increase in the total number of vaccines given, children are exposed to fewer foreign proteins (antigens) in vaccines today than in the past. Until 1972, children received about 200 proteins from just the smallpox vaccine. Today, with advances in protein chemistry, the 14 routinely recommended vaccines contain fewer than 150 proteins in total. In other words, all of the vaccines given to children today have fewer overall antigens than the smallpox vaccine alone.</p><h2>Babies are well equipped to fight off germs in the environment:</h2><p>Infants have an enormous capacity to respond safely and effectively to multiple vaccines. From the moment they are born, infants are exposed to trillions of germs in the environment and their immune systems are well equipped to handle the immune response produced by the vaccine. The immunological challenge from vaccines is very small compared to what babies’ immune systems deal with every day. In other words, babies’ immune systems are constantly fighting off germs from others and their environments every day.</p><h2>Safety is the #1 consideration:</h2><p>Before vaccines are approved for use, their safety is studied extensively. They are tested alone and in combination with the existing vaccines to determine whether they affect the safety of the other vaccines. These multiple vaccine studies are always done before a new vaccine is added to the vaccination schedule.</p><h2>What the studies say:</h2><p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics titled 'On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes” compared children who had received all their vaccines on time during the first year of life with children who did not, looking for differences in neuropsychological (this means the brain and behavior connections) outcomes at 7 to 10 years of age. The study found that timely vaccination during infancy did not cause neuropsychological outcomes in children 7 to 10 years of age and later.</p><p>There is no evidence that timely receipt of currently recommended vaccines overloads or weakens the child’s immune system. Vaccine decline or delay, on the other hand, may leave a child at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.</p><h2>References:</h2><ul><li><a href='http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm'>http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm</a></li><li>Offit PA, Quarles J, Gerber MA, Hackett CJ, Marcuse EK, Kollman TR, Gellin BG, Landry S.

Before vaccines, every year in Canada:</p><ul><li>there were 350 000 cases and 1500-2000 hospitalizations due to varicella (chicken pox)</li<li>there were 15 000 to 20 000 cases of pertussis (whooping cough)</li><li>there were over 900 cases of invasive Hib disease (eg. meningitis or pneumonia)</li></ul><p>Vaccines have reduced or eliminated many of these diseases that once routinely harmed infants, children and adults. However, even though vaccines have reduced these diseases, the germs that cause vaccine-preventable diseases still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. High vaccination rates are still required to protect children from disease and to keep the diseases out of our communities.</p><h2>Why we give babies vaccines:</h2><p>Children are given vaccines at a young age because children are most vulnerable to certain diseases when they are young. If a child is not vaccinated and is exposed to a disease, the child’s body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. The current NACI recommended immunization schedule is specifically designed to protect children when they are most at risk.</p><h2>How vaccine ingredients have changed:</h2><p>Despite the increase in the total number of vaccines given, children are exposed to fewer foreign proteins (antigens) in vaccines today than in the past. Until 1972, children received about 200 proteins from just the smallpox vaccine. Today, with advances in protein chemistry, the 14 routinely recommended vaccines contain fewer than 150 proteins in total. In other words, all of the vaccines given to children today have fewer overall antigens than the smallpox vaccine alone.</p><h2>Babies are well equipped to fight off germs in the environment:</h2><p>Infants have an enormous capacity to respond safely and effectively to multiple vaccines. From the moment they are born, infants are exposed to trillions of germs in the environment and their immune systems are well equipped to handle the immune response produced by the vaccine. The immunological challenge from vaccines is very small compared to what babies’ immune systems deal with every day. In other words, babies’ immune systems are constantly fighting off germs from others and their environments every day.</p><h2>Safety is the #1 consideration:</h2><p>Before vaccines are approved for use, their safety is studied extensively. They are tested alone and in combination with the existing vaccines to determine whether they affect the safety of the other vaccines. These multiple vaccine studies are always done before a new vaccine is added to the vaccination schedule.</p><h2>What the studies say:</h2><p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics titled 'On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes” compared children who had received all their vaccines on time during the first year of life with children who did not, looking for differences in neuropsychological (this means the brain and behavior connections) outcomes at 7 to 10 years of age. The study found that timely vaccination during infancy did not cause neuropsychological outcomes in children 7 to 10 years of age and later.</p><p>There is no evidence that timely receipt of currently recommended vaccines overloads or weakens the child’s immune system. Vaccine decline or delay, on the other hand, may leave a child at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.</p><h2>References:</h2><ul><li><a href='http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm'>http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm</a></li><li>Offit PA, Quarles J, Gerber MA, Hackett CJ, Marcuse EK, Kollman TR, Gellin BG, Landry S.

Specifically, some parents are worried that children are receiving too many vaccines while they are too young to deal with them, thus overloading their immune system. Some parents are now requesting alternative immunization schedules, either reducing or delaying the number of vaccines that their children receive in a single well-child checkup.</p><p>Parents’ concerns about the number of vaccines children receive today are understandable. There are many more vaccines offered to children today than in the past. However, there are several facts that support the use of the recommended immunization schedule.</p><h2>Why we use vaccines:</h2><p>Vaccines protect against many diseases which often result in serious complications, hospitalizations and even death. With more vaccines recommended, children can now be protected against more diseases than they were in the past. Before vaccines, every year in Canada:</p><ul><li>there were 350 000 cases and 1500-2000 hospitalizations due to varicella (chicken pox)</li<li>there were 15 000 to 20 000 cases of pertussis (whooping cough)</li><li>there were over 900 cases of invasive Hib disease (eg. meningitis or pneumonia)</li></ul><p>Vaccines have reduced or eliminated many of these diseases that once routinely harmed infants, children and adults. However, even though vaccines have reduced these diseases, the germs that cause vaccine-preventable diseases still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. High vaccination rates are still required to protect children from disease and to keep the diseases out of our communities.</p><h2>Why we give babies vaccines:</h2><p>Children are given vaccines at a young age because children are most vulnerable to certain diseases when they are young. If a child is not vaccinated and is exposed to a disease, the child’s body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. The current NACI recommended immunization schedule is specifically designed to protect children when they are most at risk.</p><h2>How vaccine ingredients have changed:</h2><p>Despite the increase in the total number of vaccines given, children are exposed to fewer foreign proteins (antigens) in vaccines today than in the past. Until 1972, children received about 200 proteins from just the smallpox vaccine. Today, with advances in protein chemistry, the 14 routinely recommended vaccines contain fewer than 150 proteins in total. In other words, all of the vaccines given to children today have fewer overall antigens than the smallpox vaccine alone.</p><h2>Babies are well equipped to fight off germs in the environment:</h2><p>Infants have an enormous capacity to respond safely and effectively to multiple vaccines. From the moment they are born, infants are exposed to trillions of germs in the environment and their immune systems are well equipped to handle the immune response produced by the vaccine. The immunological challenge from vaccines is very small compared to what babies’ immune systems deal with every day. In other words, babies’ immune systems are constantly fighting off germs from others and their environments every day.</p><h2>Safety is the #1 consideration:</h2><p>Before vaccines are approved for use, their safety is studied extensively. They are tested alone and in combination with the existing vaccines to determine whether they affect the safety of the other vaccines. These multiple vaccine studies are always done before a new vaccine is added to the vaccination schedule.</p><h2>What the studies say:</h2><p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics titled 'On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes” compared children who had received all their vaccines on time during the first year of life with children who did not, looking for differences in neuropsychological (this means the brain and behavior connections) outcomes at 7 to 10 years of age. The study found that timely vaccination during infancy did not cause neuropsychological outcomes in children 7 to 10 years of age and later.</p><p>There is no evidence that timely receipt of currently recommended vaccines overloads or weakens the child’s immune system. Vaccine decline or delay, on the other hand, may leave a child at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as whooping cough and pneumococcal disease.</p><h2>References:</h2><ul><li><a href='http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm'>http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm</a></li><li>Offit PA, Quarles J, Gerber MA, Hackett CJ, Marcuse EK, Kollman TR, Gellin BG, Landry S.
